Project 6: Weather Application


I used the weather.io API to create this React Application. 
There are predefined cities, where you are able to view the weather in real time from several countries.

This application excercises my abilities to use React, and the inner functinalities like

- using the search bar to filter out city names through a function
- use effect for fetching the cities current data,
- use state hooks for creating a weather data list, to filter data(city names)
- use state hooks for searching the input
- use state hooks for matching the temperature filter to display information based on the value.
- Implemented a navigation bar to redirect users to another site
- Design card components to show imagry and highlight any predefined city.


This took me a total of 4 days to do, and about 10 hours total.
